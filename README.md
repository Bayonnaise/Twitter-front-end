# Week 7 Makers Challenge
## Recreate the Twitter front-end

The challenge was to recreate the Twitter feed page in HTML, CSS and Javascript (using dummy data). The goal was to test our front-end skills, so we were allowed to examine the real Twitter's files, but were not to copy and paste any elements.

Goal 1: Make it look like the real Twitter on a desktop.

Goal 2: Add JS for infinite scrolling with a spinner to show data is being loaded. Expand the tweet box on focus, popup to add a new tweet.

Goal 3: Make it responsive.
