# Week 7 Makers Challenge
## Recreate the Twitter front-end

The challenge was to recreate the Twitter feed page from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript (and dummy data). A test of front-end skills.

Goal 1: Make it look like the real Twitter on a desktop.
	- COMPLETE.

Goal 2: Add JS for infinite scrolling with a spinner to show data is being loaded. Expand the tweet box on focus, popup to add a new tweet.

Goal 3: Make it responsive.
	- COMPLETE. The right column disappears when the window is too small to house it, and the remaining two columns are centred.
